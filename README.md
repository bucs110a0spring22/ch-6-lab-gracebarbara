## SUMMARY:
 In part A, I set up a counter in a while loop with an if statement in it that updates the count by one for each iteration and returns the count. Then, in the main function, I asked the user to insert an upper bound value and used a for loop to run each value of the range through the seq3np1 function and print the loop value and number of iterations within the range. In part B, I kept track of the maximum number of iterations by using a for loop to run each value through the seq3np1 function and evaluating each value through an if statement to determine the maximum number of iterations. Then, that maximum is used to set the window of the screen and each of the iterations are plotted to map out a line graph using turtle commands.
